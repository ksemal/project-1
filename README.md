CineGrub - Where Movies and Restaurants Come Together [cinegrub.com]

We created CineGrub as a site that would allow people to search for both a movie and a restaurant nearby to make planning nights out (or even afternoons) easier. CineGrub enables you to simultaneously search for food and entertainment and provides you with all the information you need to choose your favorites.

We wanted to create CineGrub as a more seamless solution to making plans with friends or figuring out date night. Several helpful sites already exist for movies and restaurants (like Yelp and Fandango), but we wanted to comebine those and create a more accessible and simpler user experience.

We discussed the main objectives of our project and decided who would focus on specific goals.

Hannah - I contributed the code for the Zomato API and provided edits and changes to website copy for grammar and spelling. I created and updated the presentation deck. I structured and wrote the ReadMe file.

Challenges we experienced were 
- including JavaScript API
- enabling zip code validation 
- setting up the Zomato API q parameter 



In the future, some features and additions we would add include 
- creating social media accounts and cultivate strong digital presence 
- enabling email invitations and notifications
- writing code that allows the enter key to submit zip code 
- converting from manual authentication to Firebase authorization for greater data protection through encryption
- adding mobile responsiveness to the website
